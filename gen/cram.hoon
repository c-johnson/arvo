  ::  test generator for the cram markdown syntax
  ::
  ::  todo: integrate with ++sail and embed in hoon compiler
  ::
  ::  ++cram is a simple markdown-inspired parser that makes
  ::  common html tropes easy to type.  you can think of ++cram
  ::  as "rational markdown" or "markdown with syntax errors."
  ::  a document format should be easy to type and read, but
  ::  that doesn't mean it can't or have rigorous syntax.
  ::
  ::  tldr: ++cram is indent-oriented.  indent 2 spaces for
  ::  a dynamic interpolation, 4 spaces for example code, 6
  ::  spaces for a blockquote and 8 spaces for verse.  separate
  ::  every semantic block by a blank line.  use - for
  ::  unordered lists, + for ordered lists.
  ::
  ::  markdown link syntax works.  * means bold, _ means
  ::  italics, "" inserts smart quotes.  all enclosed
  ::  strings are reparsed; escape the terminator within
  ::  the string, eg, *star \* in bold text*.
  ::
  ::  markdown `literal` syntax is supported, but all hoon
  ::  constants are automatically marked as code.  also, any
  ::  hoon expression prefixed with # is a code literal.
  ::
  ::  (++cram is a valid hoon parsing rule, but it does a lot
  ::  of custom processing internally, since the language is
  ::  context-sensitive.  we use a context-sensitive parser
  ::  to cut the lines into blocks, then reparse flow blocks
  ::  with normal hoon rules.  multipass parsing is the tax
  ::  humans have to pay for simple but human-friendly syntax.)
